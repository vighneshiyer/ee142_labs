\section{Calibration Details on the E5071C VNA}
The E-cal and the female/male calibration triangles are broken or don't provide good enough calibrations.
The failure mode seen with these calibration standards was occasional gain (more than 0dB return loss) on $S_{11}$ at a particular band when a short or open was connected after calibration.

We also noticed that the female separated calibration standards didn't give a very good result. The only standards that work well are the male separated standards.

When using the male cal standards, (85052-60006 - Short, 85052-60008 - Open, 902C - Load), a F-F thru needs to be used with a known delay of 51 ps, and sometimes a M-M thru needs to be used with a known delay of 98.9 ps.
When performing transmission calibration (2-port), use the M-M thru and the delay value of 98.9 ps.
This M-M thru described above is the SMA thru, \emph{NOT} the 3.5mm thru. You will know which one is which when inspecting the dielectric.

\textbf{Conclusion: Use separated male standards from 85052E.}
\section{Notes from Previous Lab 1 Attempt}

Port extensions performed on port 1 and 2 to move reference plane to end of SMA connector:
\begin{itemize}
    \item 38 ps delay (13.7mm equivalent electrical length on port 1 and 13.67mm on port 2)
    \item Loss @ DC = 0 dB
    \item Loss 1: 33mdB @ 1 Ghz
    \item Loss 2: -23mdB @ 500 Mhz
\end{itemize}

Attenuation per frequency measurements taken with the SMA dummy short:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Port 1 (598.19 Mhz, -0.04771 dB), (1.352510 Ghz, -0.08127 dB)
    \item Port 2 (598.19 Mhz, -0.05873 dB), (1.352510 Ghz, -0.08767 dB)
\end{itemize}

Measurements performed with the thru board:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Length of thru board $d_0 = 0.926 \text{ in} = 2.352 \text{ cm}$
    \item 156 ps of electrical delay $\tau_0$ required to produce flat phase on $S_{21}$
    \item $v = c_p = \frac{d_0}{\tau_0} = 1.507e8 \text{ m/s}$
    \item $\epsilon_{eff} = 3.96$ (compared to FR4 typical 4.4)
    \item $Z_{0,measured} = 49.2 \Omega$ at 4.22 Ghz
\end{itemize}

Calibration to get a 0.7mm length transmission line:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Port extend port 1 and 2 with 109ps to form a 0.7mm thru line on the thru board.
    \item To make the loss maximally flat at 0dB around 600 Mhz use:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Loss 1: 74 mdB @ 1 Ghz
        \item Loss 2: -35 mdB @ 500 Mhz
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
